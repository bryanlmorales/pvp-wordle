# pvp-wordle

# Description

pvp-wordle is my version of the famous NYTimes word-guessing game 'Wordle' and is also my senior project for CISC 4900 at CUNY Brooklyn College. The idea is very simple: write a command-line app that allows 2 players; one player gives the word and the second player has to guess what that word is.
